`Ian's Komputer: hey hey` came out first because it is ran outside the async function. The following 2 lines are priinted after the `hey hey` because they are inside the async function.

## 1.3. Multiple Spawn and removing drop

From the resulting output, it can be seen that the existence of many spawners causes more tasks to be performed because more tasks are queued into the task sender which acts like a message queue. Not dropping the spawner causes the program to never die because the program assumes that there will still be a data transmission by the spawner. drop(spawner) itself is an indication that the interaction is complete and the spawner will be closed. When a spawner calls the spawn function, it will create a new task that is channeled into the task sender. The executor will take one task from the task sender and execute it and after that take another task until the task runs out and the spawner is dropped which indicates the interaction is complete.
